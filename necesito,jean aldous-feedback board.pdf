Project Documentation - Feedback Board for a Local Business

1. Project Overview
This web application was developed as part of a practical exercise to demonstrate CRUD functionality using
PHP and MySQL.
The project scenario involved building an anonymous feedback board for a local caf√©. Customers can leave
feedback, rate their experience,
and have their comments moderated (edited or deleted) through the app. The goal was to build a clean,
working interface using basic HTML,
CSS, and PHP while connecting everything to a MySQL database.

2. Database Schema
The application uses a single table named `feedback`. Here's the SQL used to create it:
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS cafe_feedback;
USE cafe_feedback;
CREATE TABLE feedback (
feedback_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
nickname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
rating INT CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
comment TEXT NOT NULL,
date_submitted DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

3. CRUD Feature Walkthrough
- Create - Users can submit new feedback using a form that collects nickname, rating (1-5), and a comment.
Submitted data is stored in the database.
- Read - All feedback is shown on the homepage (index.php) in a table format, sorted by the newest
submissions first.
- Update - A feedback entry can be edited through the 'Edit' link, which loads a pre-filled form with the existing
data.
- Delete - Entries can be deleted by clicking the 'Delete' link. A JavaScript confirm alert ensures users don't
delete entries by accident.

5. Challenges Encountered
One of the challenges was validating input properly and ensuring that the database handled rating constraints
(between 1-5).
Additionally, ensuring secure and user-friendly navigation between forms and pages was tricky at first. I also
had to debug some errors
with data not updating due to mismatched field names. All these were solved with proper testing and using
prepared statements to secure the code.

6. Learnings / Reflections
Through this project, I learned how CRUD operations work in real-world PHP applications. I got hands-on
experience connecting front-end
HTML forms with back-end PHP scripts and handling MySQL queries securely. It helped me understand how
websites store, manage, and display data dynamically.
Overall, this project strengthened my confidence in working with full-stack development using PHP and
MySQL.
